I'm Giorgia, an Italian web designer & developer.

I prototype in Figma while keeping UI|UX fundamentals in ***Mind***.

My core stack comprises HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript (GSAP) and basic WordPress development | customisation with PHP.

My favourite project I worked on is [Elena Seris' landing page](https://fiorenzatogiorgia.netsons.org/first-project.php), showcased in my portfolio.

I design and build what I imagine, constantly learning along the way.

I’m currently broadening my skill set by self-studying Cybersecurity and Vue.js | and preparing for certification.

I'm available for work. | Open to opportunities!
